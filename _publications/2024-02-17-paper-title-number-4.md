excerpt: 'Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) aim to enhance traffic management through Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Infrastructure-to-Infrastructure (I2I) communications. However, the wireless medium and dynamic nature of these networks expose them to security threats from faulty nodes or malicious attacks. While cryptography-based mechanisms provide security against outsider attacks, the network remains vulnerable to attacks from legitimate but malicious nodes. Trust models have hence been proposed to evaluate node and data credibility to make informed security decisions. Existing models are either vehicle-centric with limited stability due to mobility or infrastructure-based with risks of single points of failure. This paper proposes a self-organizing, infrastructure-based trust model for securing ITS communication leveraging Smart Roadside Signs (SRSs). The model introduces a trust-based clustering algorithm using a fuzzy-based Dempster Shafer Theory (DST). This eliminates dependence on external trusted authorities while enhancing stability through infrastructure oversight. The decentralized trust formation and adaptive clustering balance security assurance with scalability. The results of the simulations show that our model is resilient against on-off attack, packet drop attack, jamming attack, bad-mouthing attack and collusion attack.'
