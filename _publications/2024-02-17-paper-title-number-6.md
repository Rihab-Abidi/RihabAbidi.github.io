excerpt: 'The paradigm of Social Internet of Things (SIoT) incorporates the concepts of social networking in the Internet of Things (IoT). The idea of SIoT is to allow objects to autonomously establish social relationships, which may facilitate network navigability and the discovery of information and services. The characteristics of the IoT such as the heterogeneity and the dynamicity of the network and the social relationships between devices lead to several challenges including how to build a reliable network. In this paper, we propose an adaptive trust management model that helps nodes seeking trusted service providers. The trustworthiness of a service provider is assessed on the basis of its past experiences with the requestor and of the recommendations of the requesterâ€™s neighbors. In our trust model, the trust parameters evolve dynamically in response to the change of the network context, the type of the demanded service and the nature of the relationships between the different nodes. The experiment results show that our proposed model achieves high accuracy and it is proved to be resilient against common attacks.'
